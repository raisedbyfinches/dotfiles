* TextKernel

The Industry seems to be the industry of the advertiser? There are posts on Reed which get assigned to Staffing/Employment Agencies when the actual job probably won't be with them. How would you want those treated?

Salary information isn't available in the UI, you have to read the posts.

According to this table, 23% of the jobs in the database have an unknown industry.

These industries are not aligned with SIC definitions.


Circa 232,000 have unknown profession. This is the largest group but does only account for around 3% of the total jobs listings in the last year. Similarly the O*NET-SOC 2019 codes have around 3% unknown. These are American defined SOC codes, are they different to the Eurostat SOC codes?


* Number of daily posts

This contains the entire data feed for the last year (date to date, not calendar 2024). The following table shows summary statistics of the data available for the past 365 days from 27th November 2024.

|----------+--------|
| Min      | 1649   |

* Website coverage

The coverage is actually pretty good. There are a ridiculous number of different pages. Adzuna provides 1.2M of the adverts.



* Comparison to Lightcast

The presentation from Eugene includes descriptions of content in the Lightcast dataset. This comparison is on the 2024 data.  Everything following the number of rows is percentage coverage. This values denoted with asterisks are calculated on the sample data we have received rather than through the UI. This means that it does not cover the entirety of 2024. Its worth noting that there is a large discrepancy on timeliness here, you can't compare the counts across the two when they are as distant as they are from each other.
